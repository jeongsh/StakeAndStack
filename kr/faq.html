                <span class="answer">
                  XTZ(Tez) is the native token of the Tezos blockchain. It is used to interact with dApps, pay for fees,

                <span class="answer">
                  Staking Tezos tokens provides an excellent opportunity to earn passive income in XTZ. You could liken
                  it to earning interest on your cryptocurrency holdings. In some cases, staking requires you to lock up
                  your tokens for a predetermined period, during which they are unspendable. However, this is not the
                  case with Tezos; you can spend your Tezos whenever you wish.<br><br>
                  By staking your XTZ, you contribute resources to the Tezos network, enhancing its stability. In return
                  for this support, you receive XTZ tokens as rewards.

                <span class="answer">
                  The ongoing operation of the Tezos blockchain depends on validators and delegators staking XTZ to
                  validate the network. As a reward for their contributions, they receive newly minted XTZ from the
                  network. The annual rate of creation for these new tokens is referred to as the inflation rate, which
                  is currently around 4.63%. The Annual Percentage Yield (APY)—essentially the average Return on
                  Investment (ROI)—is determined using both the current staking rate and the inflation rate. At present,
                  the APY for staking on the Tezos network is approximately 6.19%.

                <span class="answer">
                  The required minimum delegation amount is 100 XTZ. The interesting aspect of Tezos delegation is that
                  you don't delegate a specific amount of XTZ, but instead, the entire XTZ balance of your wallet gets
                  delegated when you stake. Additionally, there are transaction fees associated with delegating to a
                  validator, so it's advisable to hold more than 100 XTZ in your wallet prior to initiating the staking
                  process.

                  To stake your XTZ with Stake and Stack, you could either use a wallet that you're comfortable with or

                  If you're comfortable with handling personal wallets, simply use the staking function within your
                  wallet, find Stake and Stack on the validator list, or delegate to us directly using our wallet

                  How long does it take to stake and unstake XTZ?
                </span>
                <span class="answer">
                  On the Tezos network, staking and unstaking XTZ is a process that unfolds over a series of cycles.
                  Each cycle corresponds to the completion of 16,384 blocks—with each block being produced every 15
                  seconds.<br><br>
                  When you stake your XTZ, your delegation rights are not transferred instantly. There is a 'Pending'
                  period that lasts about 1~2 cycles (approximately 3~6 days), which serves as a measure for network
                  protection. Following this, a 'Confirmation' stage takes place over 5 cycles (around 14 days), during
                  which your delegation is verified, and the validator acquires the rights to produce and endorse future
                  blocks. Finally, another cycle (around 3 days) must pass before your first payout is issued.<br><br>

                  In total, you'll start receiving staking rewards after roughly 23 days or about 8 cycles. Previously,
                  under the operation of Tezos Seoul, the first rewards would be distributed after approximately 37 days
                  (or 13 cycles). However, since transitioning to Stake and Stack, this waiting period has been reduced
                  to 23 days (8 cycles).<br><br>

                  Once a cycle ends and a new one begins, the rewards from the previous cycle are due. With Stake and
                  Stack, these rewards are typically distributed within 24 hours of the commencement of the new
                  cycle.<br><br>

                  Regarding unstaking, your XTZ isn't locked during the staking process, so you can move or transfer
                  your XTZ at any time.<br><br>

                <span class="answer">
                  When you stake Tezos, you keep full ownership and control of your XTZ. Even after delegation, your XTZ
                  remains in your own wallet, allowing you to transfer or use it as you wish. The Tezos network only
                  locks the validators' own deposits, not the delegated XTZ. Validators cannot access or control the XTZ
                  delegated to them. This effectively makes staking Tezos similar to simply holding XTZ in your wallet,
                  but with the added advantage of earning rewards.

                <span class="answer">
                  Yes, you do maintain full control and access to your staked XTZ at all times. The unique feature of
                  Tezos staking is that it does not restrict your ability to transfer or spend your tokens. This makes
                  Tezos stand out from many other networks where your tokens are locked while staking. Consequently,
                  Tezos has a high staking ratio, and we highly recommend staking as a way to earn passive income, while
                  still being able to utilize your tokens as you see fit.

                  Can my staked XTZ be slashed, seized or destroyed?
                </span>
                <span class="answer">
                  The XTZ you stake is secure and remains in your wallet, meaning you retain complete control over your
                  tokens at all times. The process of delegating your XTZ does not pose any risk to your assets, and
                  they cannot be slashed, seized, or destroyed due to delegation. However, to keep your XTZ secure,
                  there are several best practices to bear in mind:<br><br>
                  - Never share your seed phrase with anyone.<br>
                  - Keep your seed phrase in a secure location.<br>
                  - Avoid participating in suspicious projects.<br>
                  - Be wary of clicking on dubious links, especially those promoting high returns or "too good to be
                  true" deals.<br>
                  - Only download apps or software from links provided on official websites.<br>
                  - By following these steps, you can ensure the security of your staked XTZ.<br>

                  Can I lose potential staking rewards?
                </span>
                <span class="answer">
                  Once you've delegated your XTZ, it remains in your wallet and under your control at all times.
                  However, it's essential to select your validator carefully due to the slashing mechanism of Tezos,
                  which poses a risk for validators.<br><br>

                  A validator can be penalized for not revealing nonces or double signing (signing different blocks or
                  voting on different proposals at the same level and round). The slashed amount for double baking is
                  640 tez. The slashed amount for double (pre)endorsing is a fixed percentage of 1/2 of the frozen
                  amount.<br><br>

                  A validator's security deposit, equal to 10% of the stake, is frozen at the start of each cycle and
                  returned after 5 cycles. Should the validator be caught double-signing, this deposit is confiscated by
                  the network.<br><br>

                  If a validator doesn't have sufficient funds for the security deposit for the next cycle, they and
                  their delegates lose their turn and profits—this is known as over-delegation. While this could happen
                  to Stake and Stack, we maintain a 99.9% reliability over four years, and any penalties on our
                  validator don't affect our delegators' rewards.<br><br>

                  Before delegating, ensure that the validator has sufficient capacity for your delegation to avoid the
                  risk of over-delegation.

                <span class="answer">
                  In the Tezos network, staking rewards are automatically compounded. This means that once the rewards
                  are distributed to your wallet at the end of each cycle by the validator (in this case, Stake and
                  Stack), they're automatically added to your total staked balance. Therefore, in subsequent cycles,
                  you'll be earning rewards on an ever-increasing stake amount. You don't need to claim or re-delegate
                  your rewards - the system takes care of it all, allowing your assets to grow passively.

                <span class="answer">
                  On the Tezos network, after the initial staking period of approximately 23 days (8 cycles), staking
                  rewards are distributed consistently at the end of each cycle. In terms of duration, a cycle in Tezos
                  lasts about 2.84 days, so you can expect to receive new staking rewards every 2.84 days following the
                  initial payout. This frequent reward distribution allows for efficient compounding of your staked XTZ.

                  What is the validator fee for staking with Stake and Stack?
                </span>
                <span class="answer">
                  When staking with Stake and Stack, the validator commission, or service fee, is a part of the staking
                  process. This fee is charged to each account utilizing our staking services. Importantly, this fee is
                  deducted from the rewards generated by staking, not from the staked funds themselves. It's already
                  factored into the ROI.<br><br>

                  The base fee for staking XTZ with Stake and Stack is 10% of the rewards. However, we provide numerous
                  benefits to our clients.<br><br>

                  For instance, we offer Custom Fee Discounts. These are automatic discounts applied based on the amount
                  of your stake and the staking duration, enabling you to enjoy lower fees as your stake increases or as
                  you stake for longer periods.<br><br>

                  Moreover, we have the SaS Club Membership. This is a tiered membership program that applies uniformly
                  across all networks we support. The program provides additional privileges and discounts to our loyal
                  customers, with the highest membership tier even offering up to 100% fee discounts—that's right,
                  potentially no fees at all!<br><br>

                  We offer a program called Custom Fee Discounts which automatically applies discounts based on the

                  Cosmos SDK with Ethereum's robust developer support.<br><br>

                  The KAVA token plays an essential role in three key aspects of the Kava Network: security, governance,
                  and incentives.<br><br>

                  <strong>Security:</strong> KAVA is staked by top nodes for block validation, incentivizing them via
                  block rewards and
                  transaction fees, though they risk losing KAVA for non-compliance with network rules.<br><br>

                  <strong>Governance:</strong> KAVA holders propose and vote on key network parameters, including
                  supported assets,
                  Dapps, debt limits, and financial instrument settings. They also vote on proposals affecting the
                  Network's fund allocation.<br><br>

                  <strong>Incentives:</strong> Some KAVA emissions are distributed as incentives to top projects on each
                  chain, driving
                  growth, encouraging competition, and improving the Kava ecosystem's health.<br><br>

                  In a nutshell, KAVA is an integral component of the Kava Network's security, governance, and growth
                  incentive mechanisms.

                  Can I stake my KAVA using a Ledger wallet?
                </span>
                <span class="answer">
                  Yes, you can stake your KAVA tokens using a Ledger wallet. Currently, Ledger Live does not fully
                  support KAVA, but you can import your Ledger wallet into another compatible wallet to stake your KAVA.
                  Essentially, this means you can stake KAVA held on your Ledger, but you cannot stake directly from the
                  Ledger Live app as you can with other networks like Tezos. You can securely delegate your KAVA tokens
                  to Stake and Stack to earn passive rewards.<br><br>

                  Here's a quick guide on how to stake KAVA using your Ledger wallet:<br>
                  1. Install the Keplr browser extension. You can get it here: <a href="https://wallet.keplr.app/"
                    class="link" target="_blank">https://wallet.keplr.app/</a> <br>
                  2. Select "Import Ledger" and follow the on-screen instructions.<br>
                  3. Go to the KAVA section and click on "Stake".<br>
                  4. From the validator list, find Stake and Stack and click on "Manage".<br>
                  5. Enter the amount you want to stake and click "Delegate".<br><br>
                  By following these steps, you can successfully stake your KAVA tokens using your Ledger wallet.

                  What is Kava staking?
                </span>
                <span class="answer">
                  Kava staking refers to the process of securing and validating the Kava network, a decentralized bank
                  in the Cosmos ecosystem, by locking up KAVA tokens. This can be achieved by users either validating
                  transactions themselves or delegating their tokens to a third-party validator.<br><br>

                  In return for their participation, users earn rewards in the form of KAVA tokens. These rewards,
                  accrued in real-time, can be used for transaction fees on the Kava platform or exchanged for other
                  cryptocurrencies. Staking not only helps secure the network and ensure its stability but also allows
                  users to actively contribute to the platform's operations and earn returns on their staked
                  tokens.<br><br>

                  To stake KAVA, users deposit their tokens into a staking pool and select a validator node to delegate
                  their stake. This node is then responsible for validating transactions on the network and receiving
                  rewards for its work. The rewards are distributed proportionally among all stakers based on their
                  stake amount, enabling all participants to share in the benefits of maintaining the network.

                  What is the current APY for Kava staking?
                </span>
                <span class="answer">
                  Staking on the Kava network allows validators and delegators to contribute to the ongoing operation of
                  the blockchain and receive newly minted KAVA as rewards. The rate at which these new tokens are
                  created annually is the inflation rate, currently around 59.5%.<br><br>

                  The Annual Percentage Yield (APY)—the average Return on Investment (ROI)—is determined by both the
                  current staking rate and the inflation rate. Currently, the APY for staking KAVA ranges approximately
                  from 13.0% to 26.0%. Despite the high inflation rate, the APY is lower because a significant portion
                  of the annual inflation is allocated to the community pool for developer incentives in the Kava
                  ecosystem. Please note, these rates are subject to change with future proposals and votes.

                  involved in the process of delegating to a validator and claiming your rewards. So, regardless of the
                  size of your stake, everyone is welcome to participate in securing the Kava network while earning
                  rewards for their contribution.

                </span>
                <span class="answer">
                  Staking KAVA involves selecting a validator and delegating a portion of your assets to contribute to
                  their voting power. In exchange, you receive a portion of the rewards generated from block production.
                  The staking process can typically be completed within minutes, depending on the wallet and interface
                  you're using.<br><br>

                  When you decide to unstake or undelegate your KAVA, there's an unbonding period of 21 days. During
                  this time, your assets are held in a non-transferable state. Once the unbonding period is over, your
                  assets become available for transfer or re-delegation. It's important to note that during the
                  unbonding period, you do not earn staking rewards.

                  When you stake your KAVA, you retain full ownership and control over your tokens. Validators, to whom

                  available for transfer or re-delegation. This process ensures network security while maintaining user

                <span class="answer">
                  Staking KAVA does come with certain risks, mainly stemming from validator misbehavior, including
                  double signing and prolonged downtime.<br><br>

                  Double signing refers to a validator equivocating about the state of the blockchain. If a validator
                  commits this act, it comes with a slashing penalty of 5%, meaning both the validator and their
                  delegators can lose up to 5% of their staked KAVA. However, this event is relatively rare.<br><br>

                  Downtime, on the other hand, pertains to a validator going offline for a prolonged period. The penalty
                  for this misbehavior is 0.05% of the staked KAVA.<br><br>

                  When you delegate your KAVA to a validator like Stake and Stack, they manage these risks on your
                  behalf, making the staking process less worrisome.

                <span class="answer">
                  Yes, potential staking rewards can be at risk due to several factors:<br><br>

                  1. Unbonding Risk: When you decide to unstake your KAVA, it involves a 21-day waiting period before
                  your tokens become liquid again. During this period, you're not earning any staking rewards. It's
                  important to plan your financial activities and be aware of this lock-up period if you anticipate
                  needing to liquidate your assets in the near future.<br><br>

                  2. Active Set Risk: Your staking rewards could also be at risk if your validator performs poorly, gets
                  slashed, or falls out of the top 100 validators. In such a case, you could lose out on staking
                  rewards. It's recommended to frequently monitor your validator's performance, ensure they're active,
                  and check if they have not significantly raised their commission fees.<br><br>

                  3. Protocol Security Risk: Finally, like any other blockchain protocol, KAVA has an inherent risk of
                  unknown bugs. These could potentially disrupt the network operations and consequently your staking
                  rewards. This risk is part of the broader risk landscape when investing in or staking KAVA.<br><br>

                  Hence, while staking KAVA offers a means to earn rewards, it is not without its risks and requires a
                  degree of active monitoring and planning.

                </span>
                <span class="answer">
                  Staking rewards on the Kava network are not automatically staked (compounded). They are liquid, which
                  means that they are not immediately added to your staked balance. This allows you to decide what to do
                  with them. However, if you want to take advantage of compounding, you can choose to re-stake your
                  rewards manually.<br><br>

                  Compounding involves reinvesting your earned rewards back into the staking pool, which allows your
                  investment to grow faster over time due to the power of compound interest. In other words, not only
                  does your initial investment generate earnings, but also the accumulated rewards from previous periods
                  contribute to your earning potential.<br><br>

                  Some wallet services offer functions such as 'Compounding', 'Re-stake', or 'Re-invest' to facilitate
                  this process. By using these options, your staking rewards can be compounded, effectively increasing
                  your potential earnings over time. Stake and Stack supports these compounding options.

                  Kava staking rewards are distributed frequently and in real-time. They are generated and accrued with
                  each new block creation on the network, which occurs approximately every 7 seconds. This means your
                  rewards are constantly growing as the network operates, allowing for a continuous stream of income

                  When staking with Stake and Stack, the validator commission, or service fee, is a part of the staking

                  The base fee for staking KAVA with Stake and Stack is 10% of the rewards. However, we provide numerous
                  benefits to our clients.

                  For instance, we offer Custom Fee Discounts. These are automatic discounts applied based on the amount
                  of your stake and the staking duration, enabling you to enjoy lower fees as your stake increases or as
                  you stake for longer periods.

                  Moreover, we have the SaS Club Membership. This is a tiered membership program that applies uniformly

                  Are there any ways to receive a discount on the validator fee?
                </span>
                <span class="answer">
                  Yes, Stake and Stack offers ways to receive discounts on validator fees.<br><br>

                  We offer a program called Custom Fee Discounts which automatically applies discounts based on the
                  amount staked and the staking duration. This means the more you stake or the longer you stake, the
                  lower your fee can be.<br><br>

                  Additionally, we have the SaS Club Membership, a tiered membership program that applies across all
                  networks we support. It offers additional privileges and fee discounts to our loyal customers, and the
                  highest membership tier can even provide up to 100% fee discounts—that's potentially zero
                  fees!<br><br>

                  For more detailed information about our Custom Fee Discounts and SaS Club Membership, please visit the

                <span class="answer">
                  Akash Network is a decentralized cloud computing marketplace connecting users with available computing
                  resources. Built on Tendermint and Cosmos SDK, it provides a unified platform with flexibility, cost
                  advantage, and performance benefits. The native Akash token (AKT) ensures financial security, and the
                  platform aims to foster a more decentralized web.

                  What is AKT?
                </span>
                <span class="answer">
                  Akash Network Token (AKT) is the native utility token of the Akash Network, an open-source and
                  decentralized cloud computing platform designed to make it easier, cheaper, and more secure for
                  developers to deploy applications. The Akash Network uses a unique blockchain-based auction system to
                  achieve the lowest possible price for cloud hosting services.<br><br>

                  AKT serves several key functions within the Akash ecosystem:<br><br>

                  1. Governance: AKT token holders can propose, vote on, and implement changes to the network. This
                  allows the community to directly influence the network's development and future direction.<br><br>

                  2. Securing the Network: AKT is used as a staking token. Validators in the network are required to
                  stake AKT as collateral to participate in the block production and transaction validation
                  processes.<br><br>

                  3. Incentivization: AKT tokens are used to incentivize various network participants. For instance,
                  validators are rewarded with AKT for maintaining the network and developers can earn AKT by building
                  on Akash.<br><br>

                  4. Storing and Exchanging Value: AKT serves as the default currency for all transactions within the
                  Akash Network. It can be used to pay for cloud computing resources or earned by leasing out idle
                  compute capacity.<br><br>

                  As the native utility token, AKT plays a crucial role in maintaining and operating the Akash Network.
                  It aligns the incentives of all network participants, making the ecosystem more robust and resilient.

                  Can I stake my AKT using a Ledger wallet?
                </span>
                <span class="answer">
                  Yes, you can stake your AKT tokens using a Ledger wallet. Currently, Ledger Live does not fully
                  support AKT, but you can import your Ledger wallet into another compatible wallet to stake your AKT.
                  Essentially, this means you can stake AKT held on your Ledger, but you cannot stake directly from the
                  Ledger Live app as you can with other networks like Tezos. You can securely delegate your AKT tokens
                  to Stake and Stack to earn passive rewards.<br><br>

                  Here's a quick guide on how to stake AKT using your Ledger wallet:<br>
                  1. Install the Keplr browser extension. You can get it here: <a href="https://wallet.keplr.app/"
                    target="_blank" class="link">https://wallet.keplr.app/</a> <br>
                  2. Select "Import Ledger" and follow the on-screen instructions.<br>
                  3. Go to the AKT section and click on "Stake".<br>
                  4. From the validator list, find Stake and Stack and click on "Manage".<br>
                  5. Enter the amount you want to stake and click "Delegate".<br><br>

                  By following these steps, you can successfully stake your AKT tokens using your Ledger wallet.

                  What is Akash Network staking?
                </span>
                <span class="answer">
                  Akash Network staking involves securing the network by locking up AKT tokens. Stakeholders participate
                  by either validating transactions themselves or delegating their tokens to a validator, like Stake and
                  Stack.<br><br>

                  Staking AKT gives participants a part in the network's decentralized governance and the ability to
                  earn Akash rewards, which are paid out per block. Participants can choose to either withdraw or
                  compound these rewards. The AKT token is inflationary, with the APY varying based on the staking
                  ratio.<br><br>

                  Please be aware of potential risks, which include slashing if a validator misbehaves and a 21-day
                  unbonding period when unstaking AKT. During this time, users cannot withdraw tokens or earn rewards.
                  Despite these risks, staking plays a key role in securing the Akash Network and provides an
                  opportunity to earn returns.

                </span>
                <span class="answer">
                  Staking on the Akash Network allows validators and delegators to contribute to the ongoing operation
                  of the blockchain and receive newly minted AKT as rewards. The rate at which these new tokens are
                  created annually is the inflation rate, currently around 7.58%.<br><br>

                  The Annual Percentage Yield (APY)—the average Return on Investment (ROI)—is determined by both the
                  current staking rate and the inflation rate. Currently, the APY for staking AKT ranges approximately
                  from 10.0% to 12.0%.

                <span class="answer">
                  There is no minimum staking amount when it comes to staking AKT with Stake and Stack. You can start
                  staking even with just 0.1 AKT. However, it's important to remember that there are transaction fees
                  involved in the process of delegating to a validator and claiming your rewards. So, regardless of the
                  size of your stake, everyone is welcome to participate in securing the Akash Network while earning
                  rewards for their contribution.

                  If you're uncertain about setting up your wallet, we suggest choosing the wallet used in the 'Staking
                  Guide & Instructions' section. This guide offers a straightforward procedure for setting up a wallet
                  and initiating staking.

                  How long does it take to stake and unstake AKT?
                </span>
                <span class="answer">
                  Staking AKT involves selecting a validator and delegating a portion of your assets to contribute to
                  their voting power. In exchange, you receive a portion of the rewards generated from block production.
                  The staking process can typically be completed within minutes, depending on the wallet and interface
                  you're using.<br><br>

                  When you decide to unstake or undelegate your AKT, there's an unbonding period of 21 days. During this
                  time, your assets are held in a non-transferable state. Once the unbonding period is over, your assets
                  become available for transfer or re-delegation. It's important to note that during the unbonding
                  period, you do not earn staking rewards.

                <span class="answer">
                  When you stake your AKT, you retain full ownership and control over your tokens. Validators, to whom
                  you delegate your tokens, cannot access or control your AKT. However, your staked AKT is locked and
                  can't be transferred immediately. If you decide to unstake your AKT, there's a 21-day unbonding period
                  during which your tokens remain non-transferable. After this period, your tokens become available for
                  transfer or re-delegation. This process ensures network security while maintaining user control over
                  their assets.

                </span>
                <span class="answer">
                  Yes, your staked AKT can be slashed if the validator you've delegated to behaves maliciously or
                  exhibits poor performance. Slashing happens under two scenarios:<br><br>

                  <strong>1. Downtime Slashing (Liveness Fault):</strong> If a validator is offline for around 16.5
                  hours (assuming 6.25s
                  block times), 0.01% of the staked AKT gets slashed.<br>
                  <strong>2. Double-Sign Slashing:</strong> If a validator validates the same block twice (due to
                  malicious intent or
                  poor setup), 5% of the staked AKT gets slashed.<br><br>

                  Please note that there's also a 21-day lock-up period when unstaking AKT. During this period, your AKT
                  is still subject to slashing risks.<br><br>

                  It's essential to delegate your AKT to a professional and trusted validator, like Stake and Stack, to
                  minimize these risks. Always do your due diligence when selecting a validator.

                  Can I lose potential staking rewards?
                </span>
                <span class="answer">
                  Yes, potential staking rewards can be at risk due to several factors:<br><br>

                  Unbonding Risk: When you decide to unstake your AKT, it involves a 21-day waiting period before your
                  tokens become liquid again. During this period, you're not earning any staking rewards. It's important
                  to plan your financial activities and be aware of this lock-up period if you anticipate needing to
                  liquidate your assets in the near future.<br><br>

                  Active Set Risk: Your staking rewards could also be at risk if your validator performs poorly, gets
                  slashed, or falls out of the top 100 validators. In such a case, you could lose out on staking
                  rewards. It's recommended to frequently monitor your validator's performance, ensure they're active,
                  and check if they have not significantly raised their commission fees.<br><br>

                  Protocol Security Risk: Finally, like any other blockchain protocol, AKT has an inherent risk of
                  unknown bugs. These could potentially disrupt the network operations and consequently your staking
                  rewards. This risk is part of the broader risk landscape when investing in or staking AKT.<br><br>

                  Hence, while staking AKT offers a means to earn rewards, it is not without its risks and requires a
                  degree of active monitoring and planning.

                  Are staking rewards liquid or automatically staked (compounded)?
                </span>
                <span class="answer">
                  Staking rewards on the Akash Network are not automatically staked (compounded). They are liquid, which
                  means that they are not immediately added to your staked balance. This allows you to decide what to do
                  with them. However, if you want to take advantage of compounding, you can choose to re-stake your
                  rewards manually.<br><br>

                  Compounding involves reinvesting your earned rewards back into the staking pool, which allows your
                  investment to grow faster over time due to the power of compound interest. In other words, not only
                  does your initial investment generate earnings, but also the accumulated rewards from previous periods
                  contribute to your earning potential.<br><br>

                  Some wallet services offer functions such as 'Compounding', 'Re-stake', or 'Re-invest' to facilitate
                  this process. By using these options, your staking rewards can be compounded, effectively increasing
                  your potential earnings over time. Stake and Stack supports these compounding options.

                <span class="answer">
                  Akash Network staking rewards are distributed frequently and in real-time. They are generated and
                  accrued with each new block creation on the network, which occurs approximately every 7 seconds. This
                  means your rewards are constantly growing as the network operates, allowing for a continuous stream of
                  income from your staked AKT.

                </span>
                <span class="answer">
                  When staking with Stake and Stack, the validator commission, or service fee, is a part of the staking
                  process. This fee is charged to each account utilizing our staking services. Importantly, this fee is
                  deducted from the rewards generated by staking, not from the staked funds themselves. It's already
                  factored into the ROI.<br><br>

                  The base fee for staking AKT with Stake and Stack is 10% of the rewards. However, we provide numerous
                  benefits to our clients.<br><br>

                  For instance, we offer Custom Fee Discounts. These are automatic discounts applied based on the amount
                  of your stake and the staking duration, enabling you to enjoy lower fees as your stake increases or as
                  you stake for longer periods.<br><br>

                  Moreover, we have the SaS Club Membership. This is a tiered membership program that applies uniformly
                  across all networks we support. The program provides additional privileges and discounts to our loyal
                  customers, with the highest membership tier even offering up to 100% fee discounts—that's right,
                  potentially no fees at all!<br><br>

                  What is AKT?
                </span>
                <span class="answer">
                  Akash Network Token (AKT) is the native utility token of the Akash Network, an open-source and
                  decentralized cloud computing platform designed to make it easier, cheaper, and more secure for
                  developers to deploy applications. The Akash Network uses a unique blockchain-based auction system to
                  achieve the lowest possible price for cloud hosting services.<br><br>

                  AKT serves several key functions within the Akash ecosystem:<br><br>

                  1. Governance: AKT token holders can propose, vote on, and implement changes to the network. This
                  allows the community to directly influence the network's development and future direction.<br><br>

                  2. Securing the Network: AKT is used as a staking token. Validators in the network are required to
                  stake AKT as collateral to participate in the block production and transaction validation
                  processes.<br><br>

                  3. Incentivization: AKT tokens are used to incentivize various network participants. For instance,
                  validators are rewarded with AKT for maintaining the network and developers can earn AKT by building
                  on Akash.<br><br>

                  4. Storing and Exchanging Value: AKT serves as the default currency for all transactions within the
                  Akash Network. It can be used to pay for cloud computing resources or earned by leasing out idle
                  compute capacity.<br><br>

                  As the native utility token, AKT plays a crucial role in maintaining and operating the Akash Network.
                  It aligns the incentives of all network participants, making the ecosystem more robust and resilient.

                  Can I stake my AKT using a Ledger wallet?
                </span>
                <span class="answer">
                  Yes, you can stake your AKT tokens using a Ledger wallet. Currently, Ledger Live does not fully
                  support AKT, but you can import your Ledger wallet into another compatible wallet to stake your AKT.
                  Essentially, this means you can stake AKT held on your Ledger, but you cannot stake directly from the
                  Ledger Live app as you can with other networks like Tezos. You can securely delegate your AKT tokens
                  to Stake and Stack to earn passive rewards.<br><br>

                  Here's a quick guide on how to stake AKT using your Ledger wallet:<br>
                  1. Install the Keplr browser extension. You can get it here: <a href="https://wallet.keplr.app/"
                    target="_blank" class="link">https://wallet.keplr.app/</a> <br>
                  2. Select "Import Ledger" and follow the on-screen instructions.<br>
                  3. Go to the AKT section and click on "Stake".<br>
                  4. From the validator list, find Stake and Stack and click on "Manage".<br>
                  5. Enter the amount you want to stake and click "Delegate".<br><br>

                  By following these steps, you can successfully stake your AKT tokens using your Ledger wallet.

                  What is Akash Network staking?
                </span>
                <span class="answer">
                  Akash Network staking involves securing the network by locking up AKT tokens. Stakeholders participate
                  by either validating transactions themselves or delegating their tokens to a validator, like Stake and
                  Stack.<br><br>

                  Staking AKT gives participants a part in the network's decentralized governance and the ability to
                  earn Akash rewards, which are paid out per block. Participants can choose to either withdraw or
                  compound these rewards. The AKT token is inflationary, with the APY varying based on the staking
                  ratio.<br><br>

                  Please be aware of potential risks, which include slashing if a validator misbehaves and a 21-day
                  unbonding period when unstaking AKT. During this time, users cannot withdraw tokens or earn rewards.
                  Despite these risks, staking plays a key role in securing the Akash Network and provides an
                  opportunity to earn returns.

                </span>
                <span class="answer">
                  Staking on the Akash Network allows validators and delegators to contribute to the ongoing operation
                  of the blockchain and receive newly minted AKT as rewards. The rate at which these new tokens are
                  created annually is the inflation rate, currently around 7.58%.<br><br>

                  The Annual Percentage Yield (APY)—the average Return on Investment (ROI)—is determined by both the
                  current staking rate and the inflation rate. Currently, the APY for staking AKT ranges approximately
                  from 10.0% to 12.0%.

                  staking even with just 0.1 AKT. However, it's important to remember that there are transaction fees
                  involved in the process of delegating to a validator and claiming your rewards. So, regardless of the
                  size of your stake, everyone is welcome to participate in securing the Akash Network while earning
                  rewards for their contribution.

                <span class="answer">
                  Staking AKT involves selecting a validator and delegating a portion of your assets to contribute to
                  their voting power. In exchange, you receive a portion of the rewards generated from block production.
                  The staking process can typically be completed within minutes, depending on the wallet and interface
                  you're using.<br><br>

                  When you decide to unstake or undelegate your AKT, there's an unbonding period of 21 days. During this
                  time, your assets are held in a non-transferable state. Once the unbonding period is over, your assets
                  become available for transfer or re-delegation. It's important to note that during the unbonding
                  period, you do not earn staking rewards.

                <span class="answer">
                  Yes, your staked AKT can be slashed if the validator you've delegated to behaves maliciously or
                  exhibits poor performance. Slashing happens under two scenarios:<br><br>

                  <strong>1. Downtime Slashing (Liveness Fault):</strong> If a validator is offline for around 16.5
                  hours (assuming 6.25s
                  block times), 0.01% of the staked AKT gets slashed.<br>
                  <strong>2. Double-Sign Slashing:</strong> If a validator validates the same block twice (due to
                  malicious intent or
                  poor setup), 5% of the staked AKT gets slashed.<br><br>

                  Please note that there's also a 21-day lock-up period when unstaking AKT. During this period, your AKT
                  is still subject to slashing risks.<br><br>

                  It's essential to delegate your AKT to a professional and trusted validator, like Stake and Stack, to
                  minimize these risks. Always do your due diligence when selecting a validator.

                <span class="answer">
                  Yes, potential staking rewards can be at risk due to several factors:<br><br>

                  Unbonding Risk: When you decide to unstake your AKT, it involves a 21-day waiting period before your
                  tokens become liquid again. During this period, you're not earning any staking rewards. It's important
                  to plan your financial activities and be aware of this lock-up period if you anticipate needing to
                  liquidate your assets in the near future.<br><br>

                  Active Set Risk: Your staking rewards could also be at risk if your validator performs poorly, gets
                  slashed, or falls out of the top 100 validators. In such a case, you could lose out on staking
                  rewards. It's recommended to frequently monitor your validator's performance, ensure they're active,
                  and check if they have not significantly raised their commission fees.<br><br>

                  Protocol Security Risk: Finally, like any other blockchain protocol, AKT has an inherent risk of
                  unknown bugs. These could potentially disrupt the network operations and consequently your staking
                  rewards. This risk is part of the broader risk landscape when investing in or staking AKT.<br><br>

                  Hence, while staking AKT offers a means to earn rewards, it is not without its risks and requires a
                  degree of active monitoring and planning.

                <span class="question">
                  Are staking rewards liquid or automatically staked (compounded)?
                </span>
                <span class="answer">
                  Staking rewards on the Akash Network are not automatically staked (compounded). They are liquid, which
                  means that they are not immediately added to your staked balance. This allows you to decide what to do
                  with them. However, if you want to take advantage of compounding, you can choose to re-stake your
                  rewards manually.<br><br>

                  Compounding involves reinvesting your earned rewards back into the staking pool, which allows your
                  investment to grow faster over time due to the power of compound interest. In other words, not only
                  does your initial investment generate earnings, but also the accumulated rewards from previous periods
                  contribute to your earning potential.<br><br>

                  Some wallet services offer functions such as 'Compounding', 'Re-stake', or 'Re-invest' to facilitate
                  this process. By using these options, your staking rewards can be compounded, effectively increasing
                  your potential earnings over time. Stake and Stack supports these compounding options.

                <span class="answer">
                  Akash Network staking rewards are distributed frequently and in real-time. They are generated and
                  accrued with each new block creation on the network, which occurs approximately every 7 seconds. This
                  means your rewards are constantly growing as the network operates, allowing for a continuous stream of
                  income from your staked AKT.

                </span>
                <span class="answer">
                  When staking with Stake and Stack, the validator commission, or service fee, is a part of the staking
                  process. This fee is charged to each account utilizing our staking services. Importantly, this fee is
                  deducted from the rewards generated by staking, not from the staked funds themselves. It's already
                  factored into the ROI.<br><br>

                  The base fee for staking AKT with Stake and Stack is 10% of the rewards. However, we provide numerous
                  benefits to our clients.<br><br>

                  For instance, we offer Custom Fee Discounts. These are automatic discounts applied based on the amount
                  of your stake and the staking duration, enabling you to enjoy lower fees as your stake increases or as
                  you stake for longer periods.<br><br>

                  Moreover, we have the SaS Club Membership. This is a tiered membership program that applies uniformly
                  across all networks we support. The program provides additional privileges and discounts to our loyal
                  customers, with the highest membership tier even offering up to 100% fee discounts—that's right,
                  potentially no fees at all!<br><br>

                <span class="answer">
                  Solana is a blockchain built for mass adoption. It's a high performance network that is utilized for a
                  range of use cases, including finance, NFTs, payments, and gaming. Solana operates as a single global
                  state machine, and is open, interoperable and decentralized.

                </span>
                <span class="answer">
                  Solana's native cryptocurrency is called SOL. SOL is a utility token that is used to pay for
                  transaction fees incurred when making transfers or interacting with smart contracts on the Solana
                  network.<br><br>

                  SOL operates on the Solana Program Library (SPL) protocol. This allows developers to build smart
                  contracts and create projects based on the Solana blockchain, similar to how they would on
                  Ethereum.<br><br>

                  The two primary use cases for the SOL token are:<br>
                  1. Transaction Fees: SOL is used to pay for transaction fees when users interact with the network or
                  smart contracts.<br><br>

                  2. Staking: SOL is also used in staking as part of Solana's Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Users
                  can stake their SOL tokens to help secure the network and, in return, earn rewards.

                  What is Solana staking?
                </span>
                <span class="answer">
                  Staking is the process by which a SOL token holder (such as someone who purchased SOL tokens on an
                  exchange) assigns some or all of their tokens to a particular validator or validators, which helps
                  increase those validators’ voting weight. Assigning your tokens to add to a validator’s stake-weight
                  is known as “delegating” your tokens. Delegating your tokens to a validator does NOT give the
                  validator ownership or control over your tokens. At all times, you still control all your staked
                  tokens that you may have chosen to delegate.<br><br>

                  By staking tokens with a validator or validators, the token holder indicates a degree of trust in the
                  validator they chose to delegate to. As validators amass larger amounts of stake delegations from
                  different token holders, this acts as “proof” to the network that the validator’s consensus votes are
                  trustworthy, and their votes are therefore weighted proportionally to the amount of stake the
                  validator has attracted. By weighing the collective votes from all validators against the proportion
                  of stake that has been delegated to them, the network reaches consensus by this Proof of Stake.

                  What is the current APY for Solana staking?
                </span>
                <span class="answer">
                  Solana's staking rewards follow an inflationary model with the following parameters: an Initial
                  Inflation Rate of 8%, a Dis-inflation Rate of -15% per year, and a Long-term Inflation Rate of 1.5%.
                  However, the actual Annual Percentage Yield (APY) for staking is primarily influenced by the fraction
                  of SOL staked on the network.<br><br>

                  While the total amount of staked SOL can vary, it influences the expected staking yield. Please note,
                  the idealized staking yield does not account for validator uptime, commissions, potential yield
                  throttling, or possible slashing incidents, and the percentage of staked SOL is expected to change
                  over time.<br><br>

                  Currently, the APY for staking on Solana is approximately between 6.0% and 8.0%. It's essential to
                  bear in mind these rates are estimates and can vary based on multiple factors.

                <span class="question">
                  How long does it take to stake and unstake SOL?
                </span>
                <span class="answer">
                  SStaking and unstaking SOL is not an instant process. When you delegate SOL, they are termed as
                  "activating" and do not start accruing rewards until they become fully active. Conversely, when you
                  undelegate SOL, they are referred to as "deactivating" and are not withdrawable until they are fully
                  deactivated.<br><br>

                  The transition of tokens (either becoming active or inactive) only occurs at the beginning of a new
                  epoch in the Solana protocol. An epoch on Solana lasts approximately 2 days. The timing of your
                  delegation within the epoch doesn't matter; they only become active at the onset of the next epoch.
                  This principle also applies to undelegating or deactivating a stake.<br><br>

                  Note that there's a limit to how much total stake can change its state in a single epoch across the
                  entire Solana network. A maximum of 25% of the total active stake can be activated or deactivated
                  within a single epoch. If the activation or deactivation of stakes exceeds this limit in a single
                  epoch, the remaining "activating" or "deactivating" stake will continue to transition into the next
                  epoch.<br><br>

                  In effect, while staking SOL typically spans a single epoch, unstaking SOL usually spans multiple
                  epochs, taking around 5 days to fully deactivate. During this process, the unstaking tokens are not
                  available for withdrawal.

                  When you stake your SOL, you retain full ownership and control over your tokens. Validators, to whom

                  can't be transferred immediately. If you decide to unstake your SOL, there's a 5-day unbonding period
                  during which your tokens remain non-transferable. After this period, your tokens become available for
                  transfer or re-delegation. This process ensures network security while maintaining user control over
                  their assets.

                  Can my staked SOL be slashed, seized or destroyed?
                </span>
                <span class="answer">
                  Solana operates on a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism where "slashing" can occur. Slashing is a process
                  where a portion of the stake delegated to a validator is destroyed as a penalty for any malicious
                  actions by the validator. This mechanism encourages validators to behave correctly, as having less
                  stake delegated means they earn fewer rewards. Slashing can also pose reputational risks for
                  validators, affecting their ability to retain or attract future stakes.<br><br>

                  While slashing is a potential risk, it's important to note that on Solana, slashing is not automatic.
                  If a validator acts maliciously and causes the network to halt, they can be slashed upon the network's
                  restart.<br><br>

                  As a token holder, slashing could potentially lead to a loss if you have delegated your tokens to a
                  validator that gets slashed. Therefore, it's crucial to delegate your tokens to validators who have
                  established a reputation for being trustworthy. It's also a good practice not to delegate all your
                  tokens to a single or a small number of validators to distribute the risk.

                </span>
                <span class="answer">
                  Yes, it's possible to lose potential staking rewards in the following scenarios:<br><br>

                  <strong>1. Validator Performance:</strong> The rewards you earn from staking SOL are contingent on the
                  performance of
                  the validator you delegate to. If this validator underperforms, is noncompliant, or goes offline, you
                  may receive less staking rewards than expected.<br><br>

                  <strong>2. Unbonding Period:</strong> When you decide to unstake SOL, there's a 5-day unbonding period
                  during which
                  your tokens are not earning rewards. This waiting period could result in missed earning potential,
                  especially if the network's staking yield is high during that time.<br><br>

                  <strong>3. Slashing Risks:</strong> Solana does not automatically slash validators for downtime, but
                  slashing can occur
                  if a validator behaves maliciously. Slashing destroys a portion of the validator's delegated stake,
                  which also reduces the potential rewards for delegators. Hence, your staked SOL is at risk if the
                  validator you delegated to is slashed.<br><br>

                  Always remember that staking involves a level of risk, and it's important to choose a reputable
                  validator for delegation. While staking SOL contributes to network security and decentralization, and
                  can potentially provide notable rewards, these factors need to be taken into consideration.

                <span class="answer">
                  In the Solana network, staking rewards are automatically compounded. This means that once the rewards
                  are distributed to your wallet at the end of each epoch, they're automatically added to your total
                  staked balance. Therefore, in subsequent epoches, you'll be earning rewards on an ever-increasing
                  stake amount. You don't need to claim or re-delegate your rewards - the system takes care of it all,
                  allowing your assets to grow passively.

                <span class="answer">
                  Staking rewards on the Solana network are distributed at the end of each epoch. An epoch on Solana is
                  roughly 2.4 days long. However, when you first delegate your tokens, they are considered "activating",
                  and they will not be eligible to earn rewards until the start of the next epoch.<br><br>

                  Additionally, due to network rules that limit the amount of total stake that can change state in a
                  single epoch (no more than 25% of the total active stake), if there's a high volume of stake
                  activations, your stake might remain in "activating" state for an extra epoch. In such a case, your
                  wait to start earning rewards might extend to approximately 5 days. Once activated, the stake begins
                  earning rewards. If the activation takes multiple epochs, only the portion that becomes fully active
                  at the first epoch boundary is eligible for rewards.

                <span class="answer">
                  When staking with Stake and Stack, the validator commission, or service fee, is a part of the staking
                  process. This fee is charged to each account utilizing our staking services. Importantly, this fee is
                  deducted from the rewards generated by staking, not from the staked funds themselves. It's already
                  factored into the ROI.<br><br>

                  The base fee for staking Solana with Stake and Stack is 10% of the rewards. However, we provide
                  numerous benefits to our clients.<br><br>

                  For instance, we offer Custom Fee Discounts. These are automatic discounts applied based on the amount
                  of your stake and the staking duration, enabling you to enjoy lower fees as your stake increases or as
                  you stake for longer periods.<br><br>

                  Moreover, we have the SaS Club Membership. This is a tiered membership program that applies uniformly
